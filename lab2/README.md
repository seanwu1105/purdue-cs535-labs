# Lab 2

## Spec

Make a simple interactive application that generates piecewise linear surface of
revolution.

1. It will have two windows - one to enter the object, one to visualize the
   rotating result.
2. Allow adding and removing vertices.
3. Make a nice and intuitive control: allow changing colors, etc.
4. Export the object as OBJ
5. Extra 5 points if you 3D print some nice result.
